use of JSExecutor->

- 2 types of objects are present- 
 1)Window object-(represents scrolling bar) -bydefault
 2)document object- (represents web page visible area)

why?
-scrolling operation, to scroll page
- when we have to perform action on disable elements or when selenium methods are not performing action.
- Selenium methods(click,sendKeys,etc) arenot working(when element is disable) then we can use it.

2methods->
1)executeScript()
2)executeAsynchscript()

1)executeScript(String script, object) :
-return type is object
-2nd argument is optional (when we have only scrolling web page) 
- if we have to define disable element then 2nd argument is also complusary.
- 1st argument used for scrolling operation

- to perform scrolling operation there are 2 methods-

1)scrollBy(int x-pixel,int y-pixel):
- to scroll by horizontal and vertical direction.
- we are going to scroll in form of pixels.
- to scroll top to bottom or left to right we have to define positive value.
- to scroll bottom to top or right to left  we have to define negative value.
-If we want to scroll vertical we have to assign value for y-pixel and x-pixel will be 0.
- If we want to scroll horizontal we have to assign value for x-pixel and y-pixel will be 0.

2)scrollTo() :
-  for scrolling complete height or complete width web page till last we use it.
- document.body.scrollHeight
- document.body.scrollWidth

-  to scroll by horizontal and vertical direction.
- we are going to scroll in form of pixels.
- to scroll top to bottom or left to right we have to define positive value.
- to scroll bottom to top or right to left  we have to define negative value.
-If we want to scroll vertical we have to assign value for y-pixel and x-pixel will be 0.
- If we want to scroll horizontal we have to assign value for x-pixel and y-pixel will be 0.
